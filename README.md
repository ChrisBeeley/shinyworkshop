## Shiny workshop for NHS-R for 2018 and 2019

This is a workshop that I delivered at NHS-R in 2018 and will deliver at NHS-R in 2019. The original workshop was too technical for the audience so I have greatly simplified it and removed many of the examples. The original 2018 workshop is still available in the commit history.

If attendees or anyone else wants to have a browse through some applications that I wrote for the 2018 workshop but didn't really have time to cover then please just have a poke through the commits and you can bring the 2018 version back. The 2019 version is much simplified and includes a very basic example looking at the template that is generated when you click "New Shiny app" in RStudio and one more example, which gives you all the calculation code and just asks you to provide the Shiny bits that make it hang together.
